# Three.js Shapes and Orbit Control Demo

This project demonstrates the basic use of Three.js to create and manipulate geometric shapes in a 3D scene. It leverages the power of Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The demo showcases various basic shapes, including cubes, octahedrons, spheres, cones, and toruses (donuts), each textured with different materials for visual distinction. Additionally, the project utilizes the OrbitControls from the Three.js library to enable interactive camera control, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and pan the scene intuitively.

## Features

- Geometric Shapes: Displays cubes, octahedrons, spheres, cones, and toruses, demonstrating Three.js's capabilities for creating basic 3D geometry.
- Textures: Utilizes textures to apply different appearances to the shapes, enhancing their visual appeal.
- Interactive Camera Control: Integrates OrbitControls for a dynamic viewing experience, enabling users to explore the 3D scene from various angles.
- Responsive Design: Adjusts the rendering size and camera aspect ratio on window resize, ensuring the scene looks great on any screen size.

## Technologies Used

- Three.js: For creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- OrbitControls: A Three.js extension to add user-input controls for camera movement around the scene.
- WebGLRenderer: Renders the scene using WebGL.
